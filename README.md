# DAC2932


DAC2932 devboard

## Objective

Getting a fast DAC board controlled without any FPGA, purely fast, simple, open source hardware (rp2040).

Outputs:
* 2x 40Msps, 12bits signal (I-DACs)
* 4x 1Msps, 12bits (V-DAC) (not really 4x1Msps but good enough description)


## Software

* Everything in `/software/` using classical rp2040 toolchain.

## Hardware


* Everything in `/hardware/` using classical KiCad.

This work is based on a previous TAPR project, [the echOmods project](https://github.com/kelu124/echomods/), the [un0rick project](https://github.com/kelu124/un0rick) and more recently the gamind-card, pmod-enabled format [pic0rick](https://github.com/kelu124/pic0rick/) family. Its boards are open hardware and software, developped with open-source elements.
